    <p>This keto chocolate mousse is perfect when a sweet craving hits. It's so quick it will be ready in no time. No need to pre-whip the heavy cream — just throw everything into a bowl and mix! Use any keto-friendly granular sweetener that measures like sugar. I prefer the powdered version of Swerve, since it dissolves better. Adjust cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to suit your tastes. This is quite rich, so you don't need a lot to feel satisfied.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup powdered zero-calorie sweetener (such as Swerve)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Turn mixer to low speed and slowly mix in heavy cream and vanilla. Mix in sweetener, cocoa powder and salt until well incorporated. Turn mixer to high and mix until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, or refrigerate for later.</li>
    </ol>
